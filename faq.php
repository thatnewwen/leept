	<span class="question-title">Question 1</span>
	<span class="question">Why Go to Lee Physical Therapy?</span>
	<span class="answer-title">Answer</span>
	<p>Unlike the vast majority of physical therapy clinics where you will only see the therapist for 15 mins and then spend the rest of the session doing exercises with a tech, patients will be seen by the therapist for a full hour of hands on manual work to decrease pain, become stronger, move better and improve faster in a fewer number of visits. We will get joints to move better, relieve tension, and improve strength and performance. </p></div>

		<span class="question">What's different about our clinic?</span>
		<span class="answer-title">Answer</span>
		<p>We meet you where you are. If you have been disappointed with physical therapy in the past and feel like it only helped a little or it was not helpful at all, our hands on manual therapy approach is what you need to get better.  We come to your house and provide a full 1 hour of hands on manual therapy in order to relieve pain, restore motion, and enhance performance. </p>

		<span class="question-title">Question 3</span>
		<span class="question">Direct Pay vs. Insurance</span>
		<span class="answer-title">Answer</span>
		<p>Physical therapy reimbursement rates from insurance companies are decreasing each year. It will only get worse with the direction health care is going in the United States. In order to stay in business, physical therapy clinics have to bend over backwards to bring in a higher volume of patients. This amounts to a significant decrease in quality of care.  Insurance companies require a lot of objective measurements and endless survey questionnaires to be filled out.  To get reimbursed, clinics are busy meeting the demands of insurance companies, they hire more support staff to handle patient care and individual patient care is lost in the hustle.  We do not have to constantly meet the demands of insurance companies and our focus is 100% on quality individual patient care. </p>

		<span class="question-title">Question 4</span>
		<span class="question">Do you have a prescription?</span>
		<span class="answer-title">Answer</span>
		<p>Yes: Great! we can treat you right away and get you feeling better by the end of the session</p>
		<p>No: That's okay! We will still be able to perform a full 1 hour detailed evaluation to see exactly where your problem is.  We then fax the evaluation to your primary care provider and upon receiving your doctor's signature, that evaluation is good for up to 1 year to treat you for your problems. Realistically you will feel dramatic results and only have to be seen for 4-6 weeks. </p>
